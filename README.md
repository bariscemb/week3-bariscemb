Hello!

This is Gusto Bootcamp typescript project.

I used typescript, express, mongoDB , and some other packages for the project.
I prepared:
"authControllers" as controller
"authMÃ¼ddleware" as midleware
"User" as DB Model
"authRoutes" as router
and app.ts file as main app file.

Even though I used .env file. I changed JWT_KEY with a basic string ('baris') enable you to run my project file.

Thanks for looking on my project!
